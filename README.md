   - Dive into the world of functions in Python, including defining, calling, and organizing functions to streamline your code.

7. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python:**
   - Explore object-oriented programming concepts in Python, including classes, inheritance, and importing modules for enhanced code organization and reusability.

8. **Instance Counting with Class Public Attributes:**
   - Learn how to count the instances of a class using public attributes.

9. **Private Attributes and Instance Methods:**
   - Understand how to make attributes private using double underscores and how to access them using instance methods.

10. **Exception Handling in Python:**

11. **\*args and \*\*kwargs with Examples:**
    - Explore the usage of *args and **kwargs in Python functions with illustrative examples.

12. **Decorators in Python:**
    - Understand the concept of decorators and how to use them to modify the behavior of functions or methods. Includes examples and explanations.

13. **Polymorphism in Python:**
    - Learn how polymorphism enables different objects to respond to the same method call in different ways. Includes examples demonstrating polymorphic behavior.

14. **Super Method in Python:**
    - Understand the usage of the super() method to call methods of a superclass from within a subclass's method. Includes examples illustrating the super() method in action.

15. **Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) in Python:**
    - Explore abstract base classes (ABCs) as a way to define interfaces or contracts in Python. Learn how to use ABCs to enforce method implementations in subclasses. Includes examples demonstrating the usage of ABCs.

16. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Example:**
    - Dive into an object-oriented programming example with code solution. Explore how to design and implement classes, inheritance, methods, and more in Python.
